# vllm-clj — vLLM 推論リクエストを EDN データとして

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/vllm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/vllm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An LLM inference request against a **vLLM (OpenAI-compatible) server**, defined
as **plain EDN data**, with a pure renderer to the wire shape and a normalized
response parser. Like its sibling libraries, vllm-clj treats the request as data
— generated, diffed, versioned, logged, and stored (Datomic / kotoba) like any
other EDN value — and leaves the socket to the host.

- **Zero third-party runtime deps.** Request/wire namespaces remain portable
  `.cljc` (JVM, ClojureScript, SCI); the local GGUF reader is JVM-specific.
- **Don't build JSON text.** vllm-clj renders requests to *string-keyed Clojure
  maps* and parses *string-keyed* responses; the host transport does the actual
  HTTP and JSON (de)serialization (clj-http, http-kit, hato, `js/fetch`, …).
- **Data-first.** The request is plain EDN; the network is a host-injected
  `vllm.ports/ITransport`, not a baked-in client.

Sibling libs: [jsonlogic-clj](../jsonlogic-clj) (rules-as-data),
[mcp-clj](../mcp-clj) (protocol/transport-as-data),
[torch-clj](../torch-clj) (module-graph-as-data).

## Why a shared library (org placement)

Per the three-org rule, the **reusable** request/wire kernel lives in
**com-junkawasaki**; **public-benefit** actor instances that call models live in
**etzhayyim**; any **business/private deployment** lives in **gftdcojp**.
vllm-clj is the dep — it carries no prompts and no HTTP client (those are
host-injected ports).

## The request: an inference call as EDN (`vllm.request`)

Two endpoints — chat (`/v1/chat/completions`) and text completion
(`/v1/completions`) — built with threadable data:

```clojure
(require '[vllm.request :as req])

(-> (req/chat "meta-llama/Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
              [(req/system "You are concise.")
               (req/user   "Explain CACAO in one sentence.")])
    (req/with-sampling {:vllm/temperature 0.2 :vllm/max-tokens 256})
    (req/with-base-url "http://gpu-node:8000"))
;; => {:vllm/endpoint :chat :vllm/model "…"
;;     :vllm/messages [{:vllm/role :system :vllm/content "…"} …]
;;     :vllm/sampling {:vllm/temperature 0.2 :vllm/max-tokens 256 …}
;;     :vllm/base-url "http://gpu-node:8000"}
```

## Sampling (`vllm.sampling`)

The full OpenAI surface plus vLLM extensions (`top_k`, `min_p`,
`repetition_penalty`, `best_of`, and the `guided_*` structured-output knobs),
each a namespaced key. `to-wire` maps keys to wire fields (unknown keys dropped),
`problems` does pure range checks:

```clojure
(require '[vllm.sampling :as sampling])

(sampling/to-wire {:vllm/temperature 0.7 :vllm/top-k 40 :vllm/max-tokens 128})
;; => {"temperature" 0.7 "top_k" 40 "max_tokens" 128}

(sampling/problems {:vllm/temperature 9.0})
;; => [{:vllm/severity :error :vllm/code :sampling/range …}]
```

## Wire (`vllm.wire`)

`render` produces the string-keyed body; `parse-response` / `parse-chunk`
normalize server JSON (already parsed by the host) back into `:vllm/*` EDN —
including SSE streaming deltas:

```clojure
(require '[vllm.wire :as wire])

(wire/render (req/chat "m" [(req/user "hi")]))
;; => {"model" "m" "temperature" 0.7 "top_p" 1.0 "max_tokens" 512
;;     "messages" [{"role" "user" "content" "hi"}]}

(wire/parse-response
  {"choices" [{"message" {"content" "Hello!"} "finish_reason" "stop"}]
   "usage" {"total_tokens" 10}})
;; => {:vllm/text "Hello!" :vllm/choices [{:vllm/finish-reason :stop …}]
;;     :vllm/usage {:vllm/total-tokens 10}}
```

## Validation (`vllm.validate`)

Pure structural checks (model present, roles valid, content strings, endpoint
known) plus the sampling range checks, as a vector of problem maps. `valid?` is
true iff there are no `:error`s.

```clojure
(require '[vllm.validate :as v])
(v/valid? (req/chat "m" [(req/user "hi")]))   ;=> true
(v/valid? (req/chat ""  []))                   ;=> false (no model, no messages)
```

## Ports & the call (`vllm.ports`, `vllm.core`)

The host injects an `ITransport` (and optionally `IStreamTransport`).
`vllm.core/complete` validates, builds the request spec, sends, and normalizes —
never touching a socket itself:

```clojure
(require '[vllm.ports :as ports] '[vllm.core :as core])

;; a host transport built on its HTTP client of choice
(def transport
  (ports/fn-transport
    (fn [{:keys [url method headers body]}]
      ;; host: JSON-encode body, POST, JSON-decode response
      {:status 200 :body (http-post! url headers body)})))

(core/chat transport "meta-llama/Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
           [(req/user "Hello!")])
;; => {:vllm/text "Hi there!" :vllm/usage {…} …}

;; streaming token deltas over an IStreamTransport
(core/stream transport (req/chat "m" [(req/user "count to 3")])
             (fn [delta] (print delta)))
```

Validation short-circuits before the wire (`{:vllm/error :validation …}`); a
non-2xx response becomes `{:vllm/error :http :vllm/status …}`. With the default
`ports/no-transport`, vllm-clj does no I/O and `complete` throws — by design.

## Embedded GGUF foundation (`vllm.gguf`)

The JVM runtime now has a validated GGUF v3 reader as the first local-inference
layer. `open-file` parses scalar, string, nested-array metadata and the tensor
catalog, validates alignment/block sizes/file windows, and leaves model payloads
on disk. `read-tensor-bytes` reads only one requested tensor window. Catalog
support covers F32/F16/BF16, integer tensors, and the common Q4/Q5/Q8/K-block
encodings. F32/F16/BF16, Q4_0/Q4_1/Q8_0, and the production-common
Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K superblocks can be lazily decoded into unboxed F32 arrays with
`read-tensor-f32`; remaining IQ/TQ formats fail explicitly until their block
kernels land.

The Llama loader keeps supported quantized matrices as read-only mmap windows.
Matrix-vector execution decodes one row into a reusable-sized temporary rather
than retaining a full F32 model copy; quantized token embeddings are likewise
decoded one selected row at a time.

```clojure
(require '[vllm.gguf :as gguf])

(with-open [model (gguf/open-file "/models/model.gguf")]
  {:architecture (get (:metadata model) "general.architecture")
   :tensors (gguf/tensor-names model)
   :token-embedding (gguf/tensor-info model "token_embd.weight")})
```

`vllm.llama` now executes the Llama decoder architecture with RMSNorm, RoPE,
grouped-query causal attention, SwiGLU, residuals, and a per-layer KV cache.
`vllm.tokenizer` reads the embedded Llama/SentencePiece vocabulary and performs
maximum-score segmentation; `vllm.generate` provides seeded temperature,
top-k/top-p, repetition-penalty sampling and incremental token callbacks.
Chat requests inspect the embedded vocabulary/template signature and render
the native Llama 2, Llama 3, ChatML, or Gemma turn markers. Unknown custom
Jinja remains an explicit role fallback rather than being silently treated as
one of those protocols.

`vllm.ollama` ties those layers into a closeable local model registry and pure
request handler for `GET /api/tags`, `GET /api/ps`, `POST /api/show`,
`DELETE /api/delete`, `POST /api/generate`, and `POST /api/chat`.
The handler returns Ring-like response maps and optionally emits Ollama-shaped
stream chunks. `vllm.ollama-server` exposes it through the JDK HTTP server as
real JSON or streaming NDJSON on the standard port.

```clojure
(require '[vllm.ollama :as ollama])

(def local (ollama/runtime))
(ollama/load! local "tiny" "/models/tiny.gguf")
(ollama/handle local {:method :post :path "/api/generate"
                      :body {"model" "tiny" "prompt" "Hello"
                             "stream" false}})

(require '[vllm.ollama-server :as server])
(def http (server/start! local)) ; http://127.0.0.1:11434
```

Generation runs through `vllm.scheduler`: a bounded worker/queue pool with
per-model fair semaphores, immediate overload rejection, counters exposed by
`/api/ps`, and graceful shutdown. `vllm.manifest` adds atomic model manifests
and deduplicated `sha256-*` GGUF blobs. A runtime created with
`{:model-store path}` can `install!` a model and `restore!` all named models
after restart without duplicating identical weight files.

This is still not Ollama parity: SIMD/GPU quantized matrix kernels, arbitrary
Jinja chat-template execution, continuous batching, and production-scale
throughput evidence remain required.

## Test

```
clojure -M:test
```

Real GGUF verification is opt-in so the repository does not vendor model
weights:

```sh
clojure -M:real-gguf-verify /models/stories15M-q8_0.gguf
```

The verified public fixture is `ggml-org/tiny-llamas/stories15M-q8_0.gguf`
(26.7 MB, SHA256
`2eda49203f2f044f3dddf29a7dd7cc861ef5a0340f518a19613d73ba6d9c06b6`).
On Apple M4 the current reference executor generated eight greedy tokens from
`Once upon a time` as `. He was very happy. He wanted`. This proves real GGUF
correctness across the real `/api/generate` HTTP boundary, not competitive
throughput: the optimized mmap Q8 path took 6.72 seconds through load,
scheduler, generation, and JSON response on Apple M4. The verifier's bounded
512 MB heap reduced measured maximum RSS from about
1.45 GB to 334 MB while preserving byte-identical greedy output. Large output
matrices run row-parallel with thread-local mmap views; smaller matrices stay
sequential because measured fork/join overhead was higher below 1024 rows.
